Just me practicing with Rust as a substitute for different programs I'd normally use like OpenSSL, hash utilities, etc.

## Project types so far

## 1. x509 PEM Parsing

Different tries at parsing x509 certs

## 2. SHA256 Hash

I took from [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/cryptography/hashing.html#calculate-the-sha-256-digest-of-a-file) and added the ability to add any file from your directory instead of hardcoded file names like the example

## 3. CryptoPals Challenges
- hextobase64
- fixed xor

## 4. Arti Client 
Experimented with Tor's rewritten in Rust Tor Client!
